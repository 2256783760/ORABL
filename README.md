The exponential growth of unstructured text data on the Internet presents a significant challenge in extracting entity relationship entity triplets. Complex overlaps and transmissions of relationships between entities within the same text paragraph further exacerbate this challenge, often leading to contradictory results in extraction models. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach, ORABL (Relation Extraction Model based on Overlap Rules and Abductive Learning), to address these issues. ORABL integrates an initial classifier with a rule module that identifies and corrects contradictions in the initial predictions. This iterative process continues until the model no longer produces contradictory conclusions, thereby improving the consistency of extracted relationships with natural language habits. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that ORABL outperforms state-of-the-art models in various scenarios, including SingleEntityOverlap (SEO), EntityPairOverlap (EPO), and SubjectObjectOverlap (SOO). Our results underscore the effectiveness of ORABL in handling the complexities of relationship extraction from unstructured text data.The results on the FewRel  indicate that it also has certain potential in solving the problem of few-shot
